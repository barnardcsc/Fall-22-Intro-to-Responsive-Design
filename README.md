More information about the event can be found [here](https://csc.barnard.edu/events/workshop-intro-responsive-web-design).*

## Workshop description: 
This workshop is a primer on responsive web design. We will cover media queries, the Grid and Flexbox APIs, and creating fluid images. Basic HTML & CSS knowledge is helpful, but not strictly necessary.

## In this repository, you will find the following materials:
-*README.md*: This file.
-*index.html*: A workbook for students. At the beginning of the workshop, students should make a copy so that they can work directly on their version of this file during the workshop. Contains some text to guide the flow of the workshop and comments to structure code cells, but contains minimal pre-written code.
-*index_completed.html*: Identical to the student template, but code cells are complete. Serves as a key to reference (as a print-out or on another screen) while working through the workshop.
-*responsive-design-workshop-guide.md*: In this case, it serves as something between a readme and the student key.
-*styles.css*: A workbook for students. At the beginning of the workshop, students should make a copy so that they can work directly on their version of this file during the workshop. Contains some text to guide the flow of the workshop and comments to structure code cells, but contains minimal pre-written code.
-*styles_completed.css*: Identical to the student template, but code cells are complete. Serves as a key to reference (as a print-out or on another screen) while working through the workshop.
-*images*: A folder of images to use on our webpage.
